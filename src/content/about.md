## whoami

I am DevOps engineer and a little bit SRE. At the beginning of career, I had experience in technical support, operation, and system administration. Now I want to dive into DevOps, as well as gain expertise in development, ML, and platform architecture.

I'm trying to develop my "personal brand" a little bit, but I haven't been very successful in this.

You can write me via email address or in Telegram direct messages. Both can be found [on my GitHub](https://github.com/sanchpet).
